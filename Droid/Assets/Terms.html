              <li>a reference to a statute or statutory provision is a reference to such statute or provision as amended, re-enacted or superseded from time to time and includes any subordinate legislation made under that statute or statutory provision, as amended or re-enacted; any phrase introduced by the terms including, include, in particular or any similar expression shall be construed as illustrative and shall not limit the sense of the words preceding those terms.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>

      <li><b>Basis of contract</b>
        <ol class="decimal">
          <li>In consideration of the Driver agreeing to abide by the terms of these Conditions, the Supplier grants to the Driver a non-exclusive, non-transferable licence to use the Driver App on the terms of these Conditions (the Licence) for a period of:
            <ol class="sub-list-lettered">
              <li>a minimum of 30 days (or any longer period which may be agreed between the Supplier and the Fleet Manager) prior to the Driver being linked to the Portal; and</li>
              <li>once the Driver has been linked to a Portal, for so long as the Fleet Manager continues to use the Portal;</li>
            </ol>
          until the Licence is terminated in accordance with these Conditions.  These Conditions apply to the exclusion of any other terms that the Driver seeks to impose or incorporate, or which are implied by trade, custom, practice or course of dealing.
          </li>
          <li>Any drawings, descriptive matter, or advertising produced by the Supplier and any illustrations contained on the Supplier's website are produced for the sole purpose of giving an approximate idea of the Services described in them. They shall not form part of the Agreement or have any contractual force.</li>
          <li>The Driver waives any right it might otherwise have to rely on any term endorsed upon, delivered with or contained in any document that is inconsistent with these Conditions.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>

      <li><b>Performance of the Services</b>
        <ol class="decimal">

          <ol class="sub-list-lettered">
            <li>the provision of the Driver App and the Services is dependent upon  the Driver fulfilling its obligations under these conditions, Driver Availability, and the Fleet Manager complying with its obligations under the agreement between the Fleet Manager and the Supplier;</li>
            <li>there may be circumstances beyond the Supplier's reasonable control which prevent the Driver App from being available including but not limited to disablement of the Driver App whether actively caused by a party other than the Supplier or the Driver or due to loss of connectivity;
            <br /><br />
            such that the Supplier cannot guarantee the availability of the Driver App or the Services.</li>
          </ol>
          </li>
          <li>The Driver acknowledges that, unless otherwise agreed between the Fleet Manager and the Supplier or notified by the Supplier, each Driver may only be registered to one fleet manager at any one time.

Reference source not found.</b>) and that Driver will not be able to be linked with the Fleet Manager's Portal.</li>
          <li>The Supplier warrants that it shall provide the Services with reasonable care and skill.  The terms implied by sections 3 to 5 of the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982 are, to the fullest extent permitted by law, excluded from these Conditions.</li>
